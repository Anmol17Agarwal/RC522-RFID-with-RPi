# RC522-RFID-with-RPi
RC522 RFID connects with Raspberry Pi to read and write MIFARE tags and Card. It basically used for Security Purpose. Must seen in college ID card,when it detect a valid person then only allow inside premises.

## RFID(Radio Frequency Identification)

- The device is based on the Radio frequency signals.
- The RFID systems consists of RFID Reader and a tag which is normally used in identification and tracking of objects.
- It is a device which consists of an antenna, transceiver and a decoder.
- Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) is the use of radio waves to read and capture information stored on a tag attached to an object.

## Serial Communication UART

- UART (Universal Asynchronous Transmitter Receiver), this is the most common protocol used for full-duplex serial communication. 
- It is a single LSI (large scale integration) chip designed to perform asynchronous communication. 
- This device transmit and receives data from one system to another system which done by cross connection and either transmit or recieves data from one to another system by singe connection.
